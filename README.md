# Task Management Tool

This application is a solution for an interview to demonstrate my fullstack capabilaties. This was created within the course of a day.

There is a database using mongo db expected to be hosted on 127.0.0.1:27017 for this to run. The db is called taskmanagementtool with a tasks collection.
